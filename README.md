===========

This project is a PCB layout created in KiCAD for a board to connect one or more TLC 5940 LED controllers using ordinary IDC connectors and flat cable.

It's primarily intended for use in model railroading. The board has a wide edge with mounting holes, but can easily be cut to smaller dimensions if glued to the bottom of a structure or similar purposes.
